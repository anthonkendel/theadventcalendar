        <p>
          An Advent calendar is a special calendar used to count the days of Advent in anticipation
          of Christmas. Since the date of the First Sunday of Advent varies, falling between
          November 27 and December 3 inclusive, many Advent calendars, especially those that are
          reusable, often begin on December 1, although those that are produced for a specific year
          often include the last few days of November that are part of the liturgical season. The
          Advent calendar was first used by German Lutherans in the 19th and 20th centuries.

          In Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden there is also a tradition of having a
          so-called Julekalender (Swedish: Julkalender, Finnish: Joulukalenteri, Icelandic:
          Jóladagatal; the local word for a Yule—or Christmas—calendar, even though it actually is
          an Advent calendar) in the form of a television or radio show, starting on December 1 and
          ending on Christmas Eve (December 24).
